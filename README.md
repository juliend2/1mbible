# 1MBible

Small app to read the Bible in your browser. The code AND the holy scriptures fit in 1MB. 

And that's the whole point of this project.



## Dependencies

- [https://github.com/SheetJS/bz2/](https://github.com/SheetJS/bz2/)

## Development

I use this as my dev server:

```bash
make dev
```

Make sure it all fits within 1MB (what is needed for the site to function):

```bash
make du
```
